# Universal-Offline-AI-Chatbot
Universal Offline AI Chatbot is a lightweight, extensible local assistant that answers questions based on your own PDFs â€” legal, technical, scientific, educational, or enterprise documents. It uses a fast, locally hosted LLM via Ollama, and processes your files using semantic search to provide meaningful answers.
